### Congrats you now have the app running locallyâœ¨

#### Note 1:

The Excel sheets from Tanta University are a bit "messy". They're not exactly the easiest to work with, but this app is designed specifically for them. So, trying to use a regular Excel sheet might not go as planned. ðŸ’€

#### Note 2:

Since I can't share Excel sheets with actual student data, I'll be adding some dummy data later. (In the same weird format ofc)

### Note 3:

The app is already deployed on firebase if you're just looking: [Edu-Organizer](https://exam-scheduling-system-6eb51.web.app/)
